(Yeah, probably before I finished this website. No actual date for this post, tbh. Most of the dates I put here aren't really exact.) Uh, I've been working on a roblox game which doesnt have any story or gameplay, its like a static game, just a lot of beautiful places and graphics, and its about some bit of cyberpunk, japan, dystopian/neon cities, cars, some nature...etc.
