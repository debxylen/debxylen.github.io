              well, so on 14th of august i just lost everything i had made with hardwork and so much time in the last 8 months or so... idk what to do anymore...<br>
              its been a few days since that, so i'm KINDA over it but still, it's hard to sleep when i remember this incident again...<br>
              felt kinda hopeless and helpless the first few days, but now i'm gonna try and do my best to make it back.<br>
              although i havent really made back anything yet, only lost in trying so, but i hope something is gonna work out.<br>
              sucks because it took me 8 months to get that 2.85 SOL and its gone like poof... <br>
              and if it takes 8 months to make that back, nah thats gonna be a problem...<br>
              guess a good thing is that i finally locked in harder, and teamed up with few friends, <br>
              gonna try every way to make money again although i've only been planning so far and did nothing... lazy? or just unsure.<br>
              but yeah, i thought of reaching like 4-5 figures by the end of this year but now this is a huge setback<br>
              sure i'm more locked in now, but at what cost? i need money to make more money back, and i just lost almost all of that lol.

              I keep forgetting to update this page... (Also I just realised I never SEO'd this page lol no wonder Google just wouldn't index this at all). <br>
              Idk why it feels so good to keep updating this page despite no one reading it. Maybe the reason people make diaries, although I don't really like the idea of a diary. Personal preferences maybe. <br>
              Lots of projects n shi... School is also at a rush, this current grade is apparently crucial according to parents. Must be. idk. <br>
              I don't know what specifically I am super-focusing on rn. Got 2-3 people on Fiverr and they keep on ghosting me, idk maybe cuz I'm slow. <br>
              As of my projects, Xylume has changed so much though too<br>
              So, cya all â™¥.

              Anyways, tmrw I have results and a new academic year will be starting... Means even more inactivity from me maybe :(<br>
              Also, XYL TestNet just got a huge update, basically v3, but now its renamed to Xylume TestNet. One node and the basic essential ecosystem (explorer, faucet, miner, soon a custom wallet) is deployed as of now, <br>
              so probably check it out if you wish. Shit is fast af, tested and TXs were usually processed in 100-150ms. But yeah, the current host where I deployed it, the network (internet) latency sucks, <br>
              so thats the only thing bottlenecking the main RPC as of now (which is crazy since the host CPU is bad, but even then Xylume runs so fast and is so efficient that the network latency is like a rev limiter on our racecar), <br> 
              I can afford a better host only after I earn more money... Which is hard.</div>

              Time just flies, doesnâ€™t it? If you're reading this, guess I'm still going strong on my projects, but it's been a while since I updated you all. Still grinding XYL testnet and middleware for it, some freelancing, maybe a
              kernel next? Honestly, feels like a solo adventure sometimes. Guess thatâ€™s the charm of building things from scratch, huh...? Who knows, maybe someday all these hours will add up to something huge. Until then, just gotta live

            <div class="no-display details text-gray-400 mt-4">
              XYL TestNet got a major update. A lot of things are changed. Since this is a testnet, all balances are cleared (aka just me and my testing account LOL) and minted again properly. To mention a few, smart contracts on XYL's own
              instruction set, better security and system, mining rewards, gas management are added. (This post was made on 4th of December actually. I forgot to update from a long time)
